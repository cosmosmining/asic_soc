# PROGRESS — autonomous ASIC agent log

Each entry is one loop iteration: PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → SYNTHESIZE → ANALYZE → FIX.

## Iteration 1 — RV32IM single-cycle core (bring-up)

**Goal:** stand up the repo and a correct, synthesizable, *runnable* RV32IM core
as the foundation for the 5-stage pipeline.

**Changed**
- Repo skeleton (`rtl/ tb/ formal/ tools/ gds_flow/`) + architecture diagram in `README.md`.
- `rtl/common/riscv_defs.svh` — opcode / ALU-op encodings.
- `rtl/cpu_riscv/regfile.sv` — 2R/1W register file, x0=0, write-first bypass.
- `rtl/cpu_riscv/alu.sv` — RV32IM ALU incl. MUL/MULH/MULHSU/MULHU.
- `rtl/cpu_riscv/riscv_core.sv` — single-cycle RV32IM datapath + control
  (OP, OP-IMM, LOAD/STORE w/ byte-enables, BRANCH, JAL/JALR, LUI, AUIPC, M-mul).
- `tb/directed/tb_riscv_core.sv` — directed smoke test (10 checks).
- `tools/scripts/run_sim.sh`, `tools/yosys/synth_riscv.ys`,
  `tools/openroad/riscv_core.sdc`, `formal/assertions/riscv_core_sva.sv`.

**Verify** — `run_sim.sh tb_riscv_core`: **PASS (10/10)**. Covers ADD/SUB/ADDI,
SLT/logic, a SW→LW round-trip, a taken BEQ (skips a poisoned instr), and MUL (5×37=185).

**Synthesize** — `yosys synth_riscv.ys`: clean, `check -assert` ok, netlist written.
~1023 DFFs (992 = 31×32 regfile, 32 = PC). No unsynthesizable constructs.

**What broke / fixed** — first run: all registers read 0. Root cause = **RTL bug**:
decoded fields were declared `logic x = inst[...];`, which in SV is a one-time
*initializer*, not a continuous assign — fields froze at time-0 X. Fixed by moving
to explicit `assign` (same in `alu.sv` for the signed operands). Re-ran → PASS.

**Next bottleneck** — single-cycle core has no pipeline; can't hit timing/throughput
targets and doesn't exercise hazards/forwarding (a stated requirement).

**Next single-step action** — add a self-checking instruction-by-instruction trace
comparator (golden model) so the pipeline refactor in Iteration 2 is regression-safe,
*then* split into IF/ID/EX/MEM/WB with a hazard/forwarding unit.

## Backlog (ordered)
1. Golden-trace co-sim harness for the core (regression safety net).
2. 5-stage pipeline: stage regs, forwarding unit, load-use stall, branch flush.
3. DIV/REM (M-extension) — currently placeholder.
4. CSR + minimal trap handling (mtvec/mepc/mcause) for compliance subset.
5. AXI-lite memory slave + interconnect; swap TB BRAM for it via adapter.
6. GPU SIMD lanes (vec add/mul/dot) sharing the AXI fabric.
7. ARM-like educational core.
8. OpenROAD P&R run from the Yosys netlist → GDS, timing/area reports.
